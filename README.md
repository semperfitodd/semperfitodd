### About Me
Hi, I'm Todd.

I serve as Chief Technical Officer with over 30 certifications across major cloud platforms (AWS, Azure, and Google Cloud). I lead our technical resources and ensure top-tier deliverables on every engagement.

My passion for technology began in 9th grade and has driven my career ever since. After earning my degree, I joined the Marines, where I became even more goal-oriented. My experiences in the service and as an entrepreneur—starting, running, and selling my own business—taught me invaluable lessons about speed, ownership, and continuous learning.

I am tenacious and obsessed with solving complex issues. My hands-on leadership style and personal accountability ensure that the work my teams and I produce is impactful and exceeds expectations. I am dedicated to building strong, high-performing teams and fostering a culture of continuous improvement and innovation.

Outside of work, I love to work out, be outdoors, and spend time at my kids' sports events. Living in a small peninsula lake community outside North Carolina, I enjoy supporting my children's dreams and making the most of our beautiful surroundings.
